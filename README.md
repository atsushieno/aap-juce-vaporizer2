This is a port of [Vaporizer2](https://github.com/VASTDynamics/Vaporizer2/) to [aap-juce](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-juce).

The GUI causes crashes due to insufficient porting changes for Android, but
the UI won't be usable on Android anyway. Vaporizer2 UI is quite huge even
for desktop users. DSP part seems to work.
